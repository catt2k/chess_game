## Compilation

If you have Visual Studio you can edit the source file or to recompile the application. I do suggest you to use the .sln file and compile it on relesase and x86. As the debug version of the program is very slow.

## Issues

There are quite a lot of bugs related to user inputs and chess movements. However I already fixed most of them, if there is any bugs found in your playthough please report to me.
